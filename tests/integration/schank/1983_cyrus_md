# CYRUS

Uses EMOPs (Episodic MOPs) to implement Long Term memory to add and retrieve events.

Facts are entered in coded form. For example read by FRUMP then entered into CYRUS.

## E-MOP

The internal organization of an E-MOP can be described as a net in which each node in the net is either an E-MOP or an event.

Each E-MOP has two important aspects 
* generalized information characterizing its episodes, and 
* tree-like structures that index those episodes by their differences

As for Schank's MOPs, the generalized information associated with an E-MOP is called its content frame. An E-MOP's content frame holds information describing its events, such as their usual participants, locations, and topics, and their usual relationships to other events.

One of the E-MOPs CYRUS uses is "diplomatic meetings". Each of Vance's or Muskie's diplomatic meetings that are entered into CYRUS' memory are indexed in that E-MOP. CYRUS knows that the participants of diplomatic meetings are foreign diplomats, that their topics are international contracts, that they include discussion between the
participants about the topic, that their goal is usually to resolve a disputed contract, and that they are normally part of negotiations. That is some of the information that makes up the content frame of "diplomatic meetings".

The second important feature of an E-MOP is its indices. An E-MOP's indices can index either individual episodes or specialized E-MOPs. When an E-MOP holds only one episode with a particular index, that index will point to the individual episode. When two or more episodes in an E-MOP share the same feature, its corresponding index
will point to a specialized sub-MOP (with the structure just described) which organizes the subset of events with that feature. In this way, MOP/sub-MOP hierarchies are formed.
