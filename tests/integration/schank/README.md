# Roger Schank: From CD to CBR

Systems based on theories by Roger Schank. Starting from systems working out Conceptual Dependency (CD) and ending with Case Based Reasoning (CBR) systems by Janet Kolodner.

These systems are quite modular and a specific parser may be used in several systems. I will not deal with these modules separately though, yet treat them with the system where they were first used.

## The goal of this page

Collecting all information about Schank's line of development, analysing programs, and extracting the best techniques. Extract the main line of development and collect the techniques that proved to be most useful in the end.

## Order of development

- explosion of inferences (MEMORY)
- scripts to restrict the inferences; containing roles, scenes and tracks (no way to learn similarities in scenes in different scripts), but scripts are too restrictive and don't generalize
- MOPs (Memory Organization Packets) are meant to solve this problem by reusing parts of scripts (MOPs)
- Goals and plans (to fill in the knowledge that is hard to fit in a MOP)
- TOPs: thematic structure (goals + conditions)
- CBR

## Persons

Schank starts at Yale. Wilensky starts in Yale under Schank, then sets up his own dept in Berkeley. He's not fond of MOP's developed by Schank.

## Systems

- MARGIE (1973) Schank, Goldman, Rieger, Riesbeck
- SAM (1975) Cullingford, Schank, story understanding using scripts
- PAM (1976) Wilensky, story understanding, understands the plans in a story, predicts actions based on these plans
- BELIEVER (1976) Schmidt and Sridharan - like PAM based on plans
- TaleSpin (1976) Meehan - writes stories
- FRUMP (1977) DeJong - text summarization, a bit like SAM, but skims stories using "sketchy stories"
- Qualm (1977) Lehnert, question answering for SAM and PAM
- FAUSTUS (previously: Pamela) (1983) Norvig, using frames for story understanding
- Politics (1979) Carbonell, it's about politics
- OPUS (1979) Lehnert, Burstein
- IPP (1980) Lebowitz, text skimmer - terrorism stories understander
- Plot Units (1981) Lehnert - story summary using affect
- Pandora (1982) Faletti, hierarchical planning, meta planning
- Unix Consultant (1982) - Wilensky - ask questions about UNIX
- BORIS (1982) Dyer - integration of previous structures (scripts, plans, affect); detects adages
- MOPTRANS (1984) Lytinen - translation
- KODIAK (1986) Wilensky / Berkeley - knowledge representation language
- CYRUS () Kolodner, Case Based Reasoning
- CHEF ()
- PERSUADER ()
- JUDGE ()
- MEDIATOR ()
- CABARET ()

## Data structures

* Script: see SAM
* Plan: see PAM
* Goal
* Theme
* Case
* MOP: representation of an abstracted event; reusable by multiple scripts. Schank's Memory Organization Packets (MOPs) are frames primarily used to represent episodic memory, that is, memories of particular events and their generalizations.
* TOP: thematic organization packet; defined in terms of goal situations
* TAU: thematic abstraction unit (in BORIS)
