Frame Activated Unified STory Understanding System

A single unified structure to deal with events, plot units, affect

FAUSTUS represents each class of knowledge structure as a frame

## Components

FAUSTUS is composed of three main components,

* one for linguistic processing
* one for frame-based inferences
* one for storyunderstanding specific inferences

Input is processed by PHRAN (Wilensky) which creates CD structures

## Data structures

Everything is a frame. There are different kinds of frames:

* Object frame
* Plan and goal frame
* Story point frame


## Process

Everything is a frame. The system instantiates frames. There's an active frame buffer. The frame has defaults and they are overriden while reading: a process called elaboration.
