Emotional reactions and states of affect are central to the notion of a plot or story structure.
The structure of a narrative text is a configuration of plot units, and each plot unit is itself a configuration of smaller entites called "affect states."
Affect states do not attempt to describe complex emotional reactions or states of desire in the detail that inference mechanisms would require; they merely mark gross
distinctions between "positive" events, "negative" events, and mental events of null or neutral emotionality.

Three affect states

* + (Positive Event) Events that please
* - (Negative Event) Events that displease
* M (Mental State) Mental states (w/ neutral affect)
